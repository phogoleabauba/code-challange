## Code Challenge &mdash; 001

---

- The purpose of this challenge is to showcase your coding proficiency and demonstrate your approach to code structure, standards, styling, and associated tooling. We encourage you to construct a React Web application that exemplifies your skills in these areas.

---

### Step 1: Set up the Development Environment

---

1. Install Node.js: Download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org).

2. Verify Node.js installation: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to check if Node.js is installed properly:

   `node -v`

   `npm -v`

3. Install Create React App (CRA): Open the terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install CRA globally:

   `npm install -g create-react-app`

### Step 2: Clone the project

---

1. Generate the CRA project: Run the following command to create a new React application:

   `git clone `

   This will create a new directory named code-challenge with the basic project structure and dependencies.

2. Change directory: Navigate to the project directory:

   `cd code-challenge`

### Step 3: Install Project Dependencies

---

`npm install`

### Step 4: Start the Development Server

---

1. In the terminal, run the following command to start the development server:

   `npm start`

2. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see the Code Challenge application in action.

### Step 5: Testing and Enhancements

---

1. Write tests for the components and functionality using Jest and React Testing Library. You can create test files with the .test.js extension, e.g., App.test.js, in the src directory.
2. In the terminal, run the following command to run tests:

   `npm test`

### Step 6: Build and Deploy

---

1. Once you are satisfied with the application, you can build an optimized production-ready version by running the following command:

   `npm run build`

   This will create a build folder with the minified and optimized version of your application.

2. Deploy the application to a hosting platform of your choice, such as Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
